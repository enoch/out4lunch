intro: Dig Inn is a new place that just opened on Columbia's campus this semester. Modeled after Chipotle's serving style, Dig Inn provides multiple options including sandwiches, salads, and plates in which you chose one type of protein and two sides. Their philosophy is "Real Food, Real Quality." All meats come from animals that are raised without the use of hormones and antibiotics and produce comes from local farms.

atmosphere-score: 6
atmosphere: Dig Inn is nicely decorated and, with its all wooden tables and seats, has a homey feel. My favorite seats are the ones right next to a huge window which can be opened and faces out onto Broadway. On a nice day, its very relaxing to sit, enjoy your food, and people watch. I always go around 11am for an early lunch or around 8pm for a late dinner because, at any other time, it can be very busy and impossible to find a seat. Even at its busiest, Dig Inn doesn't get too loud which is a huge plus.

taste-score: 3
taste: Overall, Dig Inn's food taste pretty good. The brown rice is a bit on the dry side but the sauce from the meatballs more than compensated. The cauliflower salad is a mix of cauliflower, raisins, and a few types of nuts. The raisins are a nice touch and add a bit of sweetness to the salad, but its masked by the ridiculous amount of salt added. The sweet potatoes are decent, nothing special. The skins are often really hard and occasionally clumped together (I've gotten a plate where most of the sweet potato was just the skin). The best part of the meal for me was definitely the meatballs which were spiced just right, enough to get a kick but not enough to burn your mouth. The only thing that sucks is, with a small plate, the serves only give three meatballs.

price-score: 3
price: Sandwiches and salads are around $7-9. Small size plates (depending on the choice of protein) are between $8-10 and large plates are between $10-13. The prices are pretty typical and what you'd expect to find in New York City.

serving-score: 2
serving: Unfortunately, the quantity of food that the servers give is ridiculously small. There was one time I ordered asparagus as a side (which costs an extra 50 cents) to get literally two pieces. I would estimate that the small plate is a little bigger than 4 x 4 inches. On a good day, in terms of quantity, the plate will mostly be filled up. In general, the servers will give three meatballs and one scoop for each side (estimate 1 or 2 ounces) or a few pieces of non scoopable foods such as the asparagus. Overall, Dig Inn portions are unfortunately small.

service-score: 5
service: The servers are all extremely friendly. Service is decently fast, though there can be really long lines during the busiest times. Unfortunately, the quantity of food that the servers give is ridiculously small. There was one time I ordered asparagus as a side (which costs an extra 50 cents) to get literally two small pieces. I go to Dig Inn mostly out of convenience, but the small servings really deter me from doing so more frequently.
